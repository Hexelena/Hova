# Hova
Just tinkering with some ideas.
Currently you have a rectangle that will follow your mouse. You can slow it down a bit by pressing space.
If you comment out the followMouse method in game.cpp you can use arrow keys to push it around.


The target is to have a "spaceship" aka a rectangle that has a booster on the right and left bottom. These can be activated to fly with it.
Interesting part is that these boosters will exert a rotational force on the ship.
I want to try to find a solution on my own on how to animate this behaviour - Oh yeah gravity would be nice too...
